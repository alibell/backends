# backends

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of backends is to provide a web API that lists all known DBI backends.
It is implemented as a set of static JSON files

## Usage

### Query all packages

```{r all, eval = FALSE}
all <- httr::GET("https://r-dbi.github.io/backends/all.json")
httr::stop_for_status(all)
all_df <- httr::content(all, flatten = TRUE, simplifyVector = TRUE)
```

```{r all-from-file, include = FALSE}
all_df <- jsonlite::fromJSON("docs/all.json", flatten = TRUE)
```

```{r all-url}
all_df$url <- purrr::map_chr(all_df$url, glue::glue_collapse, ", ")
all_df
```

### Query a single package

```{r single}
first_name <- all_df$name[[1]]
first_url <- paste0("https://r-dbi.github.io/backends/by-package/", first_name, ".json")
first <- httr::GET(first_url)
httr::stop_for_status(first)
httr::content(first)
```
